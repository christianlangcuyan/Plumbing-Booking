Plumbing Booking System
---
This project was developed for Sewer and Drain Plumbing Services LTD. to enhance data organization and minimize the time spent on manual data entry.

Purpose
---
This web application was created as the “Capstone” project for the Software Development program at SAIT. Along with four other team members, I designed, developed, tested, and deployed this application for our client, Sewer and Drain Plumbing Services LTD. Previously, the client’s data entry, storage, and service booking were managed entirely on paper, leading to organizational challenges and data loss. Our task was to design and implement a web application that streamlined the booking process and improved data maintenance and storage.

Functionality

Employee (Technician)
- Limited access

- Can view but not edit the full schedule
